#### As a member of Caltech's [Graduate Honor Council](http://www.gradoffice.caltech.edu/current/hc), I help uphold the Caltech Honor Code.

#### I tutor local middle school and high school students in STEM through the [Caltech Y Rise Program](https://caltechy.org/programs_services/tutoring/)

#### I mentor undergraduate students through Caltech's [Women Mentoring Women program](http://diversity.caltech.edu/WMW).
